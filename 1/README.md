## Highlights:

* The simulation used the parameters from Hossain's paper in 2017
* True value calculation: With covariates adjustment 
* MMI function: jomo 

## Files:

* The *ipw.R* is the simulation codes file.
* The *IPW.RData, IPW2.RData, IPW3.RData, IPW4.RData* are the saved R results. 
* The *Results.R* combines the output results.
* The *True effect.R* calculated the true effect of the intervention arm in the simulation.
* More details of the results are contained in the *ipw_results1.pdf* file.
* The *ipw_results1.Rmd* is the Rmarkdown file to generate the report.
